## Possible game structure:

├── Cargo.lock                # Auto-generated by Cargo, records the versions of dependencies used.
├── Cargo.toml                # Project configuration, defines dependencies and metadata.
├── README.md                 # Project description, setup, and instructions.
├── index.html                # Web entry point, sets up the canvas for the game.
└── src/
    ├── app.rs                # Manages the overall game lifecycle: game loop, initialization, and updates.
    ├── gpu.rs                # Handles GPU setup and resource management (wgpu setup, swap chain, etc.).
    ├── lib.rs                # Exposes the public API, serves as a modular entry point.
    ├── main.rs               # Entry point of the Rust program, calls App::run() to start the game.
    ├── renderer.rs           # Handles the actual rendering logic (drawing game objects, etc.).
    ├── scene.rs              # Manages the game world state, positions, and interactions of entities.
    ├── uniform_binding.rs    # Manages uniform buffers that store data for GPU shaders (e.g., transforms, colors).
    ├── vertex.rs             # Defines the vertex structure and buffers for rendering (positions, texture coords).
    ├── game/                 # Folder for game logic: entities, behaviors, world state.
    │   ├── mod.rs            # Entry point for the `game` module, exposes other game files.
    │   ├── player.rs         # Handles player character logic: movement, interactions, actions.
    │   ├── enemy.rs          # Defines enemies: AI, movement, interactions with the player.
    │   └── world.rs          # Manages the game world: level data, terrain, and entities.
    ├── graphics/             # Folder for graphics-related code: sprites, textures, etc.
    │   ├── mod.rs            # Entry point for the `graphics` module, aggregates sprite and texture handling.
    │   ├── sprite.rs         # Manages sprites (2D images), their positions, and animations.
    │   └── texture.rs        # Handles textures: loading, binding, and managing texture resources for sprites.
    ├── input/                # Handles player input (keyboard, mouse, controllers).
    │   ├── mod.rs            # Entry point for the `input` module, aggregates input handling files.
    │   └── keyboard.rs       # Manages keyboard input, handling events like movement, actions, etc.
    └── utils/                # General-purpose utility code (math functions, helpers).
        ├── mod.rs            # Entry point for utility functions, aggregates helpers.
        └── math.rs           # Contains math helpers: vector operations, collision detection, transformations.

## Some other packages I may want to add for game dev:

For reading and displaying images:
`image = "0.25.5"`

For reading and displaying files:
`tokio = { version = "1.41.1", features = ["full"] }`

For reading and playing sounds:
`rodio = "0.20.1"`

For making API calls:
`reqwest = { version = "0.12", features = ["json"] }`

Standard math:
`nalgebra = "0.33.2"`

3D math:
`nalgebra-glm = { version = "0.19.0", features = ["convert-bytemuck", "serde-serialize"] }`
